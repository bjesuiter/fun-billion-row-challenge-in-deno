Seems like this is the original challenge:

## Rules 

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is deceptively simple: 
1. Write a TS program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and 
2. calculating the min, mean (Durchschnittstemperatur), and max temperature per weather station. 

### Input
A text file with 1.000.000.000 rows with data formatted like 
   ```
    Hamburg;12.0
    Bulawayo;8.9
    Palembang;38.8
    St. John's;15.2
    Cracow;12.6
   ```

### Output 

```
{Abha=5.0/18.0/27.4, Abidjan=15.7/26.0/34.1, Abéché=12.1/29.4/35.6, Accra=14.7/26.4/33.1, Addis Ababa=2.1/16.0/24.3, Adelaide=4.1/17.3/29.7, ...}
```

## What do I need to do conceptually? 

1. Read each line of the input 
2. Process the Line 
    1. find the wheather station in the cache 
    2. check wether the current value changes _min_ or _max_ of this station, in this case store it 
    3. store the _sum_ and the _count_, to be able to generate the mean temp for each station later
3. Alphabetically order this list of stations and calculate mean temp for each station  
4. Output
